3.0.20180214-134325.e135900 (February 14, 2018)
-----------------------------------------------

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   Pipeline jobs using the plugin will now fail during execution if a policy action is set to fail the build. This is different from previous behavior which would set the build result to failure but allow the build to continue. This is adopting standard practice for Jenkins pipeline plugins and allows more visibility into what has failed and why. Pipelines that require continuation of the build will have to surround the plugin step with try catch, where the evaluation information is now wrapped in the exception argument.

-   The pipeline step has always returned a model for the evaluation containing information about the [results](https://help.sonatype.com/integrations/nexus-and-continuous-integration/nexus-platform-plugin-for-jenkins#NexusPlatformPluginforJenkins-ReturnValuefromPipelineBuild). The ApplicationPolicyEvaluation will no longer include a boolean for reevaluation therefore calls to get or set this will fail. The Jenkins pipeline has never supported reevaluation and this boolean has always returned false. For simplification, it has been removed.

### CHANGES

-   Module.xml evaluation support. The Nexus Platform Plugin for Jenkins now supports policy evaluations against results generated by the clm-maven-plugin index goal. The new plugin will scan module.xml files available in '**/sonatype-clm/module.xml', '**/nexus-iq/module.xml' and will support module exclude patterns to exclude these files if desired.
-   Fix for directory structure of JavaScript files scanned by the plugin
-   No longer requires optional parameters to be declared in declarative pipelines
-   All users can now select credentials for jobs as long as they have the appropriate permissions to configure the job and view the credentials
